Problem Clarity
Students and lifelong learners are often overwhelmed by large volumes of text-based study material. The process of manually creating study aids like flashcards is tedious and time-consuming. While digital tools exist, they either require manual input or are locked behind expensive, inflexible subscription models that don't suit the sporadic needs of a typical student.

Solution Quality
AI Study Buddy directly addresses this problem by offering a robust, monetized, and user-centric solution.

Innovation: It leverages a powerful AI model to intelligently generate question-and-answer pairs from any text, transforming passive notes into an active learning tool with zero manual effort.

Flexible Monetization: Instead of a rigid monthly subscription, the application uses a credit-based system. Users can make small, one-time purchases for credits, which is a more accessible and user-friendly model for students on a budget. This aligns cost directly with usage.

Security: The integration of Stripe Checkout ensures that all payment data is handled securely on Stripe's servers, drastically reducing our PCI compliance burden. The backend uses secure password hashing and a robust authentication system (Flask-Login) to protect user accounts.

Efficiency & Scalability: The backend caches generated flashcards based on a hash of the source text. This means if ten users input the same Wikipedia article, the AI is only queried once, saving significant computational resources and API costs, while delivering instant results for subsequent users.
